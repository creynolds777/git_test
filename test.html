        <h3>Monday December 27,2021</h3><hr>
        <p>Worked a full day today on almost 4 hours of sleep. When I got home I tried to lay down, but of course my step-father decided otherwise. I got startled away because I am obviously the only one in the house hold that knows how to order pizza. Once everyone else returned from Sanibel Island we opened presents and once again had to deal with my emotional Aunt Debbie. I love her to dealth, but man she cries sooo much. My daughter has yet to warm up to me. I fear she cares more for her step-father then she will ever care for me. Now why is this idk other then what her mother is constantly telling her.</p>
